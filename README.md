## [React](https://reactjs.org/) Weather 

---

This project was my first Web Application built in ReactJS. 

Just for learning purposes!

Weather Data from: [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Procedure (Replace devalparikh with your username)

1. **Create an *empty* repository on GitHub.** (2 minutes)

    * For this tutorial, I'll create a repository named `react-gh-pages`.
    * By *empty*, I mean *without* a `README.md` file, a `.gitignore` file, a `LICENSE` file, or any other files.

2. **Create a new React app on your computer.** (5 minutes)

    ```sh
    $ create-react-app react-gh-pages
    ```
    
    * This is the app you will deploy to GitHub Pages in step 7.
    * I opted to give the app the same name as my GitHub repository (i.e. `react-gh-pages`). However, you can name them differently from one another (e.g. you can name your app `app-123` and your GitHub Repository `repo-456`).
    * This will create a new folder named `react-gh-pages` (or whatever you named your app) on your computer.

3. **Install the `gh-pages` package as a "dev-dependency" of the app.** (1 minute)

    ```
    $ cd react-gh-pages
    $ npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```
    
    * The commands shown in the following steps can all be issued from within the app's folder.

4. **Add some properties to the app's `package.json` file.** (3 minutes)

    * At the top level, add a `homepage` property. Define its value to be the string `http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`, where `{username}` is your GitHub username, and `{repo-name}` is the name of the GitHub repository you created in step 1. Since my GitHub username is `gitname` and the name of my GitHub repository is `react-gh-pages`, I added the following property:
    
    ```js
    //...
    "homepage": "http://devalparikh.github.io/react-gh-pages"
    ```
    
    * In the existing `scripts` property, add a `predeploy` property and a `deploy` property, each having the values shown below:

    ```js
    "scripts": {
      //...
      "predeploy": "npm run build",
      "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
    }
    ```
    
    * **Shortcut:** Instead of adding those properties using a text editor; if I have `sed` installed on my system, I can add the properties by issuing the following shell commands:
    
    ```sh
    $ sed -i '5i\  "homepage": "http://gitname.github.io/react-gh-pages",' ./package.json
    $ sed -i '15i\    "predeploy": "npm run build",' ./package.json
    $ sed -i '16i\    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",' ./package.json
    ```
    
5. **Create a git repository in the app's folder.** (1 minute)

    ```
    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in C:/path/to/react-gh-pages/.git/
    ```

6. **Add the GitHub repository as a "remote" in your local git repository.** (1 minute)

    ```
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/react-gh-pages.git
    ```
    
    * This will make it so the `gh-pages` package knows where you want it to deploy your app in step 7.
    * It will also make it so git knows where you want it to push your source code (i.e. the commits on your `master` branch) in step 8.

7. **Generate a *production build* of your app, and deploy it to GitHub Pages.** (2 minutes)

    ```
    $ npm run deploy
    ```
    
    * That's it! Your app is now accessible at the URL you specified in step 4.
    * In my case, my app is now accessible at: https://devalparikh.github.io/react-gh-pages/
    * I recommend exploring the GitHub repository at this point. When I explored it, I noticed that, although a `master` branch did not exist, a `gh-pages` branch did exist. I noticed the latter contained the *built* app code, as opposed to the app's source code.

8. **Optionally, commit your source code to the "master" branch and push your commit to GitHub.** (1 minute)

    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Create a React app and publish it to GitHub Pages"
    $ git push origin master
    ```

    * I recommend exploring the GitHub repository once again at this point. When I did that, I noticed that a `master` branch now existed, and it contained the app's source code.
    * So, the `master` branch held the source code, and the `gh-pages` branch held the *built* app code.

# Notes

* I created this React app using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 
* And now, you can code for `create-react-app` app.
